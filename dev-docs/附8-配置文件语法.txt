 from boost 1.39.0 source code (boost\program_options\detail\config_file.hpp)
 ==================================================================================
 
        Syntax conventions:

        - config file can not contain positional options
        - '#' is comment character: it is ignored together with
          the rest of the line.
        - variable assignments are in the form
          name '=' value.
          spaces around '=' are trimmed.
        - Section names are given in brackets. 

         The actual option name is constructed by combining current section
         name and specified option name, with dot between. If section_name 
         already contains dot at the end, new dot is not inserted. For example:
         @verbatim
         [gui.accessibility]
         visual_bell=yes
         @endverbatim
         will result in option "gui.accessibility.visual_bell" with value
         "yes" been returned.
